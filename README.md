# Jetpack Compose Snake Game
This repository contains a simple Snake game written in Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building Android user interfaces. The game is a classic take on the popular Snake game where players control a snake that grows in length as it eats food, while avoiding obstacles and its own tail.

# Getting Started
To play the game, you need to have Android Studio installed on your computer. Once you have Android Studio installed, follow these steps to run the game on your device or emulator:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/ArtemZolotukh1n/SnakeGame

Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project" from the welcome screen.

Navigate to the location where you cloned the repository and select the SnakeGame folder.

Once the project is loaded, click on the "Run" button in the toolbar or press the Shift + F10 key combination to run the game on your device or emulator.

# How to Play
The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat as much food as possible without running into obstacles or the snake's own tail. The game is played on a grid of squares, and the snake can move in four directions - up, down, left, and right.

To control the snake, use the directional buttons on the screen. The snake will move in the direction of the button you pressed, and will continue to move in that direction until you press a different button or the game ends.

The game ends when the snake collides with an obstacle or its own tail. Your score is the number of food items the snake has eaten.
